## Intro
Naabu wants to become the tool teachers, curriculum designers, and researchers use to improve learning outcomes. The tool allows creating a library of learning goals using a Wikipedia-like consensus approach. Teachers can create interactive learning activities and attach them to the learning goals. With this library of learning goals and activities, teachers can create new course modules where they just have to specify the learning goals they are teaching in class. 

The project is build in  [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Algolia Search](https://www.algolia.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Still in active development and it should not be used for production environments! Help wanted! Feel free to use the issue queue or reach out by [Discord](https://discord.gg/tz2CSSrBgt)

We stream development live every workday on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/seriouspapa) and you can watch the streams back on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9M52Jh9fKPGNF8HGBAbsqw).

## Roadmap
This roadmap can still be changed based on stakeholder input but it gives an idea about the direction where we expect the project will be going.

2022:
- Q1: Open source support and create more interactive learning activities.
- Q2: Implement [moment-to-moment learning curves](https://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/ryanbaker/GraphReplayBakerEtAlJLS08132013.pdf) dashboards.
- Q3: More features for teachers to better control the teaching of course modules.
