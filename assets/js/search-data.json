Svelte kit tests containers is needed to connect to the Firebase service in the Docker containers. So firebase-code instead of localhost. This allows Playwright to be run in the Docker container which is useful for quick testing and the continuous integration system. Jekyll is the documentation in Github. Storybook is running in the svelte-kit images. We have split the build into core images that install all dependencies but not the code. The idea is that we do not need to update dependencies that often and we often change the code. The split will make it easier for other developers to work on the project as they do not run into dependencies issues as much and will have a faster initial Docker build. ",

    "title": "Technical reasons",
    "content": "Outsourcing infrastructure work . From experience, setting up and maintaining infrastructure can take a lot of work. Using an system like Firebase outsources much of this work without extra cost to cloud resources. The Naabu tool needs a place to run on and we would have hosted it with a cloud solution anyway and Google cloud is a good fit because of support for Tensorflow. Scalable by default . The Firebase stack with the Firestore and Firebase functions are scalable by design. All the scaling will be done automatically and there should be little technical work needed when the traffic increases exponentially. Attributed-based access control with Firestore. Authentication and authorization is an important aspect to get right. Firebase Auth lets us pick between many providers so users can use there Google account to create an account for Naabu. Furthermore, it has support for custom Auth systems which should help when you need to make an custom integrations for school systems. For the authorization part it is important to be able to specify who has access to what data. The most flexible way of creating such a system is using attributed-based access control (ABAC). Firebase integrated a rules system with Firestore where you can determine access based on attributes. Event driven backend architecture build on top of Google Cloud functions. Event driven architecture’s are useful to keep the code clean. However, it is difficult to set up yourself. Every Firebase Function is transferer to a Google Cloud function and will run on its own machine. They are triggered by events from Firestore and Firebase Auth and make the system flexible to extend. One use case we have is to use Python Google Functions to retrieve the best activities for users using machine learning. Python functions can also trigger on the Firebase events making the whole system pretty extensible to anything we need. Alternatives to Google functions are AWS Lambda on the Amazon cloud. A buzzword that is often used to describe these functions is serverless architecture. This serverless paradigm plays well with SvelteKit that embraces this serverless paradigm that can be contrasted to running your own node.js servers. ",

Some people can use this non-open source as the reason for not using this project. Server Side Rendering (SSR) support . With a serious attempt to get SSR working with Firebase we ran into many issues. It seems that Firebase is still behind supporting the serverless paradigm related to SSR. They do support server side rendering but expect special server code that handles the rendering. With SvelteKit we have the same code run both on the initial load of the server and on the client. SvelteKit support . Svelte Kit support adapters but Firebase is not an official adapter. There is a community SvelteKit Firebase adapter that works well and contains very little magic. What it does is that it moves the compiled SvelteKit code to a functions/ssr directory and in the functions/index.js file we can write our Firebase functions code. For SvelteKit it creates one ssr function that executes the SvelteKit code. With Firebase hosting we can serve this function from a domain. ",
